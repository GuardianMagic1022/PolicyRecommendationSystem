strategy. the strategy was unveiled \\non world ip day on april 26, 2018. it will help canadian innovators \\nbetter understand, protect and leverage their ip and compete on  \\nthe global stage.\\njohanne bélisle \\ncommissioner of patents, registrar of  \\nt rade-marks and chief executive officer\\nthis vision is at the core of cipo’s \\nnew five- y ear business strategy \\n(2017–2022), which positions ip as \\na crucial element underpinning \\ncanada’s innovation performance. \\ncipo’s five priorities are to advance \\ninnovation, to deliver quality \\nand timely ip rights, to build ip \\nawareness and education, to offer a \\nmodern service experience and to \\nfoster an agile and high-performing \\norganization.\\nin 2017–2018, the first year of \\nour five-year plan, we reached \\nsignificant milestones toward the \\nimplementation of five international \\nip treaties for industrial design, \\ntrademarks and patents. we expect \\nto complete accession to the hague \\nagreement for industrial design \\nin november 2018. we continued \\nour advocacy on the international \\nstage toward harmonization of \\nthe ip system, through the world \\nintellectual property organization \\n(wipo) and its various committees and bilateral agreements with other \\nip offices. \\nover the past few years, we have \\nimproved the quality and timeliness \\nof our services. it should be noted \\nthat our patent branch received iso \\n9001:2015 certification in june 2017, \\npositioning cipo among the world’s \\nleaders in the delivery of quality \\npatent rights.\\nt o support our business objectives, \\nwe launched a new strategy for \\nachieving service excellence. we \\nhave increased dialogue with our \\nclients and conducted a nationwide \\nclient satisfaction survey to guide our \\nservice improvement efforts. we are \\ncommitted to building a culture of \\nservice excellence that puts clients \\nat the centre of how we design and \\ndeliver our services.\\nwe launched our new ip awareness \\nand education program in may 2017 \\nto better equip canadian innovators and companies to use ip as a \\nstrategic tool to help them grow and \\nsucceed in the marketplace. this \\ninnovative new program is part of \\nthe national ip strategy and is being \\ndelivered in partnership with other \\norganizations, including the national \\nresearch council, the business \\ndevelopment bank of canada and \\nthe canadian bar association, to \\nname a few.\\nthe commitment and skills of \\nour workforce are key to our \\nsuccess. we continue to invest in \\nemployee development and talent \\nmanagement, and in 2017–2018, \\nwe started an active recruitment \\ncampaign to hire up to 60 new \\npatent examiners over the next three

course for building a world-leading innovation \\neconomy that creates opportunities for the middle class and for all canadians. one element of the plan is \\na comprehensive national ip strategy that ensures ideas and creativity are successfully commercialized and \\nfirms grow to scale with the help of their ip assets. the strategy recognizes the need to adapt to a changing \\neconomy by improving commercialization outcomes for canadian businesses and supporting their growth.  \\na modern and robust ip regime is essential to achieving this.\\nmodernizing the ip system\\ncanada recognizes the importance of ip rights in building \\nand supporting trade relationships. we are a strong \\nsupporter of increased harmonization of the global ip \\nsystem. this is why cipo has been diligently moving \\nahead to ratify five international treaties: the madrid \\nprotocol, the singapore t reaty, the nice agreement, the \\npatent law t reaty and the hague agreement. the coming \\ninto force of the hague agreement is expected in late \\n2018, with the implementation of the remaining treaties \\nby 2020. joining these ip treaties will support canadian \\nbusinesses looking to enter or expand their presence \\nin international markets by providing them with a faster, \\nsimpler and more cost-effective way to acquire ip rights \\nin multiple countries. canada’s membership in these \\ntreaties will also help attract foreign investment and \\nfacilitate international competitiveness and trade .\\nin 2017–2018, cipo led a series of public consultations \\non proposed amendments to industrial design and \\ntrademark regulations. the final regulations are expected \\nto be published in 2018–2019 and are an important \\nstep toward treaty accession and the modernization of \\ncanada’s ip framework. in september 2017, cipo also held pre-consultations for changes to the patent rules  \\nthat will be available for public comment in 2018. \\nfollowing the implementation of the canada-european \\nunion comprehensive economic and t rade agreement \\n(ceta) in september 2017, cipo amended the trade-\\nmarks act  to expand canada’s geographical indication \\n(gi) system, previously limited to wines and spirits, to \\ninclude agricultural products and food. a geographical \\nindication is a designation used on products that have \\na specific geographical origin and possess qualities \\nor a reputation that are due to that origin. under the \\nceta, over 170 geographical indications were added to \\nthe list of protected gis in canada. as the responsible \\nauthority for administering canada’s gi system, cipo \\ndeveloped new administrative procedures in consultation \\nwith agriculture and agri-food canada and global \\naffairs canada and implemented system changes and \\nprocesses to accept the new types of gi applications and \\nadminister objection proceedings. these changes benefit \\nconsumers by providing more assurance on

barriers or obstacles limiting the innovation \\nperformance of canada\\'s smes, including:  access to talent , access to financing, rising input \\ncosts, and unstable market demand for their goods and service s. \\n● several of these issues have been compounded by the covid -19 pandemic and the nature of \\ncanada’s economic recovery.  \\n● this study examines what barriers are limiting the innovation performance of canadian smes \\nand how they are using talent from work -integrated -learning (wil) programs to address those \\nchallenges.  \\n● our research involves examining project applications submitted to mitacs\\'s business strategy \\ninternship (bsi) program. this reveals that talent access is a key issue inhibiting sme innova tion \\nperformance throughout canada’s

for all canadians. one element of the plan is \\na comprehensive national ip strategy that ensures ideas and creativity are successfully commercialized and \\nfirms grow to scale with the help of their ip assets. the strategy recognizes the need to adapt to a changing \\neconomy by improving commercialization outcomes for canadian businesses and supporting their growth.  \\na modern and robust ip regime is essential to achieving this.\\nmodernizing the ip system\\ncanada recognizes the importance of ip rights in building \\nand supporting trade relationships. we are a strong \\nsupporter of increased harmonization of the global ip \\nsystem. this is why cipo has been diligently moving \\nahead to ratify five international treaties: the madrid \\nprotocol, the singapore t reaty, the nice agreement, the \\npatent law t reaty and the hague agreement. the coming \\ninto force of the hague agreement is expected in late \\n2018, with the implementation of the remaining treaties \\nby 2020. joining these ip treaties will support canadian \\nbusinesses looking to enter or expand their presence \\nin international markets by providing them with a faster, \\nsimpler and more cost-effective way to acquire ip rights \\nin multiple countries. canada’s membership in these \\ntreaties will also help attract foreign investment and \\nfacilitate international competitiveness and trade .\\nin 2017–2018, cipo led a series of public consultations \\non proposed amendments to industrial design and \\ntrademark regulations. the final regulations are expected \\nto be published in 2018–2019 and are an important \\nstep toward treaty accession and the modernization of \\ncanada’s ip framework. in september 2017, cipo also held pre-consultations for changes to the patent rules  \\nthat will be available for public comment in 2018. \\nfollowing the implementation of the canada-european \\nunion comprehensive economic and t rade agreement \\n(ceta) in september 2017, cipo amended the trade-\\nmarks act  to expand canada’s geographical indication \\n(gi) system, previously limited to wines and spirits, to \\ninclude agricultural products and food. a geographical \\nindication is a designation used on products that have \\na specific geographical origin and possess qualities \\nor a reputation that are due to that origin. under the \\nceta, over 170 geographical indications were added to \\nthe list of protected gis in canada. as the responsible \\nauthority for administering canada’s gi system, cipo \\ndeveloped new administrative procedures in consultation \\nwith agriculture and agri-food canada and global \\naffairs canada and implemented system changes and \\nprocesses to accept the new types of gi applications and \\nadminister objection proceedings. these changes benefit \\nconsumers by providing more assurance on the origins \\nand authenticity of agricultural products and foods.\\n\\n10\\ncipo annual report 2017–2018\\nwipo green  is an interactive

complement traditional means of recruitment, \\ncipo hired a first cohort of patent examiners in october \\n2017. a second cohort is set for 2018–2019. recruitment \\nthus far has tapped into a range of talent pools in canada \\naimed at increasing employee diversity in jobs related \\nto science, technology, engineering and mathematics \\n(stem). in total, 60 new patent examiners are expected \\nto be hired over the next four years.\\nemployee development and  \\nan inclusive work environment\\n \\nin march 2018, cipo launched a new training and professional development framework designed to assist managers \\nand employees in identifying individual training needs and devising tailored learning plans. we continued to help our \\nemployees with their professional development through a mentoring program to foster knowledge sharing, by providing \\ndevelopmental work experiences and cross-training and by offering tailored orientation and training to new examiners.\\n\\nin 2017, cipo ran a number of initiatives to \\nrecognize the 150th anniversary of canada’s \\nconfederation. in partnership with the royal \\ncanadian mint, we created a commemorative \\ncoin featuring a canadian industrial design to \\ncelebrate all the inventions canadians have \\npatented to enrich people’s lives, of which \\nthere are more than a million.\\nwe actively promote the use of both official languages \\nin the workplace. in 2017–2018, more than 125 employees \\nreceived official language training supporting their \\nprofessional development and their ability to offer \\nbilingual service to the public. we also developed a \\nstrategy to increase the official language fluency of \\nemployees in managerial and supervisory positions,  \\nwhich will be implemented in 2018–2019. \\nwe advanced diversity and inclusion as part of our \\nworkplace culture by hosting various awareness-raising \\nevents for topics such as the international day of pink, \\naboriginal awareness week and mental health week. \\nworkplace wellbeing and mental health are a federal \\ngovernment priority—one that cipo fully embraces. in \\n2017–2018, we held regular events to foster a healthy and \\nrespectful workplace, reduce the stigma surrounding \\nmental health and bring attention to the resources \\navailable to support employees.\\nsound stewardship\\nover the last couple of years, cipo underwent a \\nprogram evaluation of its patent services and internal \\naudits of its trademark operations and information \\ntechnology (it) modernization program. while the \\nresults were positive, a number of areas were identified \\nwhere performance could be improved. in response, we \\nhave taken action to further reduce turnaround times \\nfor patent applications in certain market segments \\nand have increased the promotion of the accelerated \\nexamination processing options available to clients. \\nwe also developed a long-term plan for the processing \\nof trademark applications that aims to streamline \\noperations and increase employee capacity to improve \\nservice quality and timeliness. we have taken measures \\nto strengthen the governance and monitoring of it \\nprojects, proposing systemic improvements to how  \\nit testing is managed.  \\ndemonstrating our continued sound financial \\nmanagement practices, cipo received an unqualified \\nfinancial audit opinion from an external auditor in \\n2017–2018. our yearly financial audits ensure that we  \\nare compliant with the annual reporting requirements  \\nfor revolving funds described by the receiver general \\nfor canada and that we are operating as intended.\\n20 cipo annual report 2017–2018\\n\\n21\\ncipo annual report 2017–2018\\na look ahead  \\ncipo supports innovation through

\\n \\n \\n \\n  ● a key component in canada’s long -lived innovation performance difficulties is the limited \\ncapacity of the country\\'s nearly 1.15 million smes to innovate.  \\n● research indicates that there are several key barriers or obstacles limiting the innovation \\nperformance of canada\\'s smes, including:  access to talent , access to financing, rising input \\ncosts, and unstable market demand for their goods and service s. \\n● several of these issues have been compounded by the covid -19 pandemic and the nature of \\ncanada’s economic recovery.  \\n● this study examines what barriers are limiting the innovation performance of canadian smes \\nand how they are using talent from work -integrated -learning (wil) programs to address those \\nchallenges.  \\n● our research involves examining project applications submitted to mitacs\\'s business strategy \\ninternship (bsi) program. this reveals that talent access is a key issue inhibiting sme innova tion \\nperformance throughout canada’s innovation ecosystem.  \\n● we see that skilled talent acquired through innovation -related wil programs can help drive \\nsme innovation, encourage product and market diversification strategies, technological \\nupgrading, and the development of more sustainable growth trajectories.  \\n\\n3 \\n mitacs.ca  contents  \\n \\nhow talent can help unlock the

      "To evaluate Canada's current standing and efforts towards improving its position relative to the United Kingdom and the United States in innovation by focusing on the aforementioned factors, let's break down Canada's situation in each area:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Human Capital**:\n",
      "   - Canada is recognized for its high quality of life and education system. It boasts one of the highest rates of tertiary education completion among OECD countries. The country also attracts international talent through immigration policies targeted at skilled workers, including those in STEM fields. However, ongoing investments and reforms in education, especially in promoting STEM education and vocational training, are crucial to maintaining and enhancing this position. Canada's approach to lifelong learning, re-skilling, and up-skilling of the existing workforce could further solidify its competitive edge in human capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Research and Development (R&D) Spending**:\n",
      "   - When it comes to R&D spending, Canada has a mixed record. The Gross Domestic Expenditure on R&D (GERD) as a percentage of GDP has traditionally been lower in Canada than in leading OECD countries. However, the Canadian government provides significant R&D tax incentives, notably through the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) program, which is one of the most generous tax incentive programs worldwide. Increasing direct investment in R&D and enhancing incentives for private sector investment are ongoing challenges that Canada needs to address to keep pace with or outstrip its peers.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Collaboration Between Universities and Industry**:\n",
      "   - Canada has established several initiatives and funding mechanisms to promote collaboration between academia and industry. Programs such as the Networks of Centres of Excellence and the Canada Foundation for Innovation aim to bridge the gap between research and its application in industry. Nevertheless, compared to the United States and the United Kingdom, Canada can further strengthen these ties. Emphasizing industry-relevant research, streamlining intellectual property policies, and fostering entrepreneurship within university settings could enhance the translational impact of academic research.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Entrepreneurial Ecosystem**:\n",
      "   - Canada’s entrepreneurial ecosystem has been steadily gaining momentum, supported by a favorable business environment, high levels of venture capital activity (especially in tech hubs like Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal), and a culture increasingly supportive of innovation and startups. The ecosystem is robust, with numerous accelerators, incubators, and angel investors supporting startups. However, compared to the highly dynamic ecosystems of the United States (e.g., Silicon Valley) and emerging sectors in the United Kingdom (e.g., fintech in London), Canada may still have room to grow in terms of scale, international investment attraction, and fostering unicorns (startups valued at over $1 billion).\n",

For example, if you want to your strategy be targeted investment in emerging technologies, you should specify it in which kind of technology, like electrical cars or superconducting materials.: \"To evaluate Canada\\'s current standing and efforts towards improving its position relative to the United Kingdom and the United States in innovation by focusing on the aforementioned factors, let\\'s break down Canada\\'s situation in each area:\\n\\n1. **Human Capital**:\\n   - Canada is recognized for its high quality of life and education system. It boasts one of the highest rates of tertiary education completion among OECD countries. The country also attracts international talent through immigration policies targeted at skilled workers, including those in STEM fields. However, ongoing investments and reforms in education, especially in promoting STEM education and vocational training, are crucial to maintaining and enhancing this position. Canada\\'s approach to lifelong learning, re-skilling, and up-skilling of the existing workforce could further solidify its competitive edge in human capital.\\n\\n2. **Research and Development (R&D) Spending**:\\n   - When it comes to R&D spending, Canada has a mixed record. The Gross Domestic Expenditure on R&D (GERD) as a percentage of GDP has traditionally been lower in Canada than in leading OECD countries. However, the Canadian government provides significant R&D tax incentives, notably through the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) program, which is one of the most generous tax incentive programs worldwide. Increasing direct investment in R&D and enhancing incentives for private sector investment are ongoing challenges that Canada needs to address to keep pace with or outstrip its peers.\\n\\n3. **Collaboration Between Universities and Industry**:\\n   - Canada has established several initiatives and funding mechanisms to promote collaboration between academia and industry. Programs such as the Networks of Centres of Excellence and the Canada Foundation for Innovation aim to bridge the gap between research and its application in industry. Nevertheless, compared to the United States and the United Kingdom, Canada can further strengthen these ties. Emphasizing industry-relevant research, streamlining intellectual property policies, and fostering entrepreneurship within university settings could enhance the translational impact of academic research.\\n\\n4. **Entrepreneurial Ecosystem**:\\n   - Canada’s entrepreneurial ecosystem has been steadily gaining momentum, supported by a favorable business environment, high levels of venture capital activity (especially in tech hubs like Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal), and a culture increasingly supportive of innovation and startups. The ecosystem is robust, with numerous accelerators, incubators, and angel investors supporting startups. However, compared to the highly dynamic ecosystems of the United States (e.g., Silicon Valley) and emerging sectors in the United Kingdom (e.g., fintech in London), Canada may still have room to grow in terms of scale, international investment attraction, and fostering unicorns (startups valued at over $1 billion).\\n\\nIn conclusion, Canada has made significant strides in each of these areas but faces the challenge of continuously improving to not just catch up with but also potentially surpass the United Kingdom and the United States in terms of innovation. Enhancements in human capital development, increased R&D spending, more effective collaboration between universities and industry, and an even stronger entrepreneurial ecosystem are key areas where strategic actions can drive Canada\\'s innovation agenda forward.\".'"

wind electricity generation costs fell by around \\n13\\xa0percent between 2020 and 2021 (see dashboard). this means that 70\\xa0percent (96\\xa0percent) \\nof the solar (wind) generation capacity newly installed in 2021 is cheaper and thus more \\ncompetitive than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired new generation option (see figure 6). this \\nmakes it possible to target cost-saving incentives at encouraging the adoption of low-emission \\ntechnologies, instead of relying on regulation or taxation to deter high-emission activities. \\nhowever, despite this notably positive progress, the decrease in cost recorded in 2021 may not \\ncontinue into the future, owing to rises in associated material costs that are yet to be passed \\nonto customers.17 even though, at present, the exceptionally high price of fossil fuels far \\noutweighs increases in material commodity prices, the future is uncertain, not least because of \\ngeopolitical volatility and its unpredictable effect on fossil fuel prices.\\n\\nglobal innovation index 2023 37 figure 6 \\u2003share of newly-installed renewable power generation capacity that is cheaper \\nthan the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option,

making evs increasingly affordable. however, following more than a decade \\nof decreasing prices, the rising cost of raw materials and battery components, coupled with \\nsoaring inflation, resulted in a first ever increase in the cost of a lithium-ion battery pack, up \\n7.1\\xa0percent in 2022 compared to the year before (i.e., from usd 141 to usd 151/kwh). indeed, \\nprices could have risen even further, if not for the greater use of alternative low-cost battery \\nmaterials like lithium-ion phosphate in the production process and a continued reduction in the \\nuse of expensive cobalt.\\nbattery prices are projected to remain at a similar level next year, contrary to significant \\ndeclines in the past. however, starting in 2024, as lithium prices ease and additional extraction \\nand refining capacity becomes available, battery prices are projected to resume a downward \\ntrajectory. the day that battery packs fall to a price of usd 100/kwh (relative to usd 151/kwh \\ntoday) is thought to be the day that evs will be no different in purchase price to petrol and diesel \\npowered vehicles. ambitious policy programs that emphasize the strengthening of domestic \\nsupply chains and encourage reshoring of electric battery and ev production have contributed \\nto increased local supply.\\ncost of genome sequencing\\npart of the ongoing deep science innovation wave (see gii 2022 special theme ), future medical \\ninnovation is particularly dependent on advances in genetics and stem cell research. in turn, \\ndna sequencing plays a crucial role in understanding the human genome, which has numerous \\npotential applications in health care, including in the rapid diagnosis of complex diseases and \\nthe fight against new viruses such as covid-19.\\nthe cost and time involved in sequencing a human or other organism’s genome are important \\nfactors in the success of dna sequencing technology. the cost of sequencing an entire genome \\nhas decreased dramatically over the years, based on estimates valid for the united states. \\nas shown in figure 7, it has fallen from approximately usd\\xa0100\\xa0million in 2001 to just over \\nusd\\xa0500 in 2022. this rapid decrease in cost, driven by advancements in next-generation dna \\nsequencing methods, far outpaces the progress expected from moore\\'s law, highlighting the

below usd\\xa0500, with the advent of new sequencing \\ntechnologies, and made accessible to the general public, especially in health care settings.\\nnew, forward-looking metrics will also be required in order to assess the speed and cost of \\nmore advanced dna sequencing techniques in the future. emerging long-read dna sequencing \\ntechnologies provide for more accurate identification of complex structural variations, but they \\nare more expensive and require different metrics to track progress.19\\nfinally, the pricing and accessibility of dna sequencing outside of the united states, and \\nparticularly in low- and middle-income nations, will be a key metric of success that needs to be \\ndeveloped further.\\ndrug approvals\\ndrug approvals provide an insight into the cutting-edge pharmaceutical treatments being \\nintroduced to the market. in the united states – which boasts the world’s biggest drugs market – \\nthere were 37 approvals in 2022, marking a 26\\xa0percent decline from 2021. looking at the 10-year \\ntrend shows a slight average annual decline of 0.5\\xa0percent over the period.\\nwhat can we gather from these numbers? on the one hand, the 37 approvals in 2022 indicates a \\nsignificant decrease in the number of new drugs entering the market compared to the previous \\nfive years. this challenges the optimism surrounding scientific advancements such as mrna \\nand crispr technology, which were expected to stimulate a wave of new pharmaceutical \\ntreatments. on the other hand, historical data show that annual drug approval numbers are \\nprone to fluctuation. the 10-year downward trend overall is largely the result of a short-term \\nincrease in 2012 and a short-term decrease in 2022. the coming years will reveal whether \\nthe decline observed in 2022 was an anomaly or indicative of a more fundamental drop in \\ndrug approvals.\\n\\nglobal innovation index 2023 39 technology adoption\\nthe global state of technology adoption reveals both progress and challenges in addressing \\npressing global issues. access to safe sanitation has improved, but over 40\\xa0percent of the \\nworld’s population continues to lack safe sanitation. industrial robot installation has surged, \\ndriven by supply chain disruption and automation efforts, leading to increased efficiency and \\nreshoring. electric vehicle sales are booming, with positive ripple effects on battery production. \\nmeanwhile, the availability of radiotherapy for cancer treatment remains inadequate in many \\ncountries, likely owing to financial constraints, lack of trained personnel and infrastructural \\nchallenges. overall, technology penetration rates are still medium-to-low, with the exception of \\nmobile broadband.\\nsafe sanitation\\nin an effort to track the adoption of health-related innovations, the global innovation tracker \\nnow includes data on the availability of safe sanitation. safe sanitation refers to that proportion \\nof the population that uses an improved sanitation facility that is not shared and is safe. this \\nindicator shows important progress over the last two decades, with a notable improvement of \\n1.4\\xa0percent between 2021 and 2022 (compared to 2.4\\xa0percent over 2012–2022). progress has \\nbeen quickest in central and southern asia (+6.6\\xa0percent over 2012–2022) driven by a strong \\ngrowth in availability of safe sanitation in india and east and south east asia (+4.6\\xa0percent) \\nattributable to progress in china.\\nin 2022, 57\\xa0percent of the world’s population (4.5\\xa0billion people) had access to safe sanitation. \\na decade earlier, it was still only 45\\xa0percent, and in 2000 it stood at 32\\xa0percent. since 2012, \\n1.3\\xa0billion people have gained access to safe sanitation across all regions, and 2.5\\xa0billion since \\n2000.20 that said, there is still a long way to go. a little under half of the global population of \\n3.5\\xa0billion people still lacks safe sanitation. to reach the sustainable development goal target \\nof universal coverage by 2030, the annual rate of progress would need to increase to 7.4\\xa0percent \\nfrom 2022 onward, up from 2.4 percent over the last decade. disaggregated data also reveal \\nsignificant disparities in access to safe sanitation both between and within countries. the \\nsituation remains dire in rural areas, where coverage is lower (46\\xa0percent) than in urban areas \\n(65\\xa0percent), and in some of the world’s regions, such as sub-saharan africa, only just under a \\nquarter of people (24\\xa0percent) have safe sanitation.\\nconnectivity\\nin 2022, fixed broadband subscriptions grew by 4.8\\xa0percent, while mobile broadband \\nsubscriptions grew by 6\\xa0percent, both below the 10-year average. mobile broadband adoption \\nis more widespread, with 87 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants.21 in contrast, fixed broadband \\nsubscriptions stood at only 17.6 per 100 inhabitants, though these are typically shared within \\nhouseholds and therefore cover more people. penetration rates for fixed broadband – which is \\noften necessary for more advanced applications – remained poor in low-income economies.\\nconnectivity to 5th generation mobile networks\\xa0(5g) could help make up for lagging fixed \\nbroadband subscriptions rates. this new standard allows for faster, more reliable data \\ntransmission, and better suits the operation of connected machines, objects and devices \\n(the internet of things), and thereby serves as an enabler unlocking the full potential of the \\ndigital era.\\nin 2021, according to estimates, 19\\xa0percent of the world\\'s population was covered by 5g. \\neurope had the highest rollout at 52\\xa0percent, followed by latin america and north america \\nwith 38\\xa0percent and the asia-pacific region at 16\\xa0percent. high infrastructure costs, device \\naffordability, and regulatory and adoption barriers remain the primary obstacles to 5g \\ndeployment and could foster a digital divide.22\\nrobots and automatization\\nthe number of industrial robots currently in operation grew by 14.6\\xa0percent between 2020 \\nand 2021 (see dashboard) to 3.4\\xa0million robots. major supply chain disruption due to the \\ncovid-19 pandemic and other disruptions to global trade have driven increased automation \\n\\nglobal innovation index 202340 and reshoring efforts – together boosting new robot installations to a record high of 0.5\\xa0million \\nin 2021, representing a growth rate of 31.4 percent on 2020. robots have also become less \\ncomplicated to operate, owing to their programming being increasingly intuitive to non-experts, \\nthanks to advancements in user-friendly interfaces and sensor technologies.23\\nthe top five markets for industrial robots are china, which leads with 52\\xa0percent of new \\ninstallations, followed by japan (9\\xa0percent), the united states (7\\xa0percent), the republic of korea \\n(6\\xa0percent) and germany (5\\xa0percent). combined, these five countries represented 78\\xa0percent of \\nnew robot installations globally, in 2022.24\\nelectric vehicles\\ndemand for evs is booming. in just two years, the market share of ev sales worldwide surged \\nfrom 4\\xa0percent in 2020 to 14\\xa0percent in 2022. sales of evs surpassed 10\\xa0million units, marking a \\nremarkable 55\\xa0percent increase between 2021 and 2022, while traditional car sales slumped by \\n3\\xa0percent.25 this was despite the first ever observed increase in electric battery pack prices in \\n2022 (see technological progress section above). moreover, cars are just the first wave: electric \\nbuses and trucks will follow soon, while electric three-wheelers are already booming in major \\nmarkets such as india, where over half of its three-wheeler registrations in 2022 were electric.\\nencouraging ev trends are generating positive ripple effects for battery production and supply \\nchains. ambitious policy programs that put an emphasis on strengthening domestic supply \\nchains and encourage reshoring – such as the european union’s\\xa0(eu) net zero industry act and \\nthe united states’ inflation reduction act – have sparked significant planned investment by \\nmajor ev and battery makers. to maximize the environmental benefits from ev transition, it is \\ncrucial to simultaneously address not only the sources of the electricity used to charge evs, but \\nraw material extraction and battery disposal.26\\nnevertheless, at present, out of every car on the world’s roads (in 2022) only 2.1\\xa0percent are \\nelectric (see dashboard). this represents an ev stock of 26\\xa0million, half of which is in china \\n(13.8\\xa0million). europe maintained its position as the second largest market for electric cars \\nworldwide, in 2022, accounting for 30\\xa0percent of global stock. evs remain the fastest growing \\nindicator (+59.9\\xa0percent and more than five times the stock in 2018, see dashboard) in the global \\ninnovation tracker this year, and further growth can be expected, regardless of uncertainty \\nconcerning how attractive traditional petrol or diesel vehicles will continue to be in the future.\\ncancer radiotherapy\\nto better capture the adoption of health-related innovations, the 2023 global innovation tracker \\nincludes data on the availability of cancer therapy equipment. a significant measure in the field \\nof radiation oncology and medical physics is the total number of linear accelerators\\xa0(linacs) – \\ndevices for delivering high-energy x-rays or electrons to cancers for a therapeutic or palliative \\npurpose – per cancer case requiring radiotherapy.\\nthis metric can be regarded as a measure of the accessibility of cancer treatment infrastructure \\nat the global level. international atomic energy agency\\xa0(iaea) and directory of radiotherapy \\ncentres (dirac) data show cancer therapy has become less widely available, declining by \\n−1.4\\xa0percent in the short term (2020–2022) and by −1.3\\xa0percent over the last decade (2012–2022). \\nthis suggests there has been an increase in cases of cancer requiring radiotherapy without an \\nadequate corresponding increase in the number of linacs, potentially leading to longer waiting \\ntimes for patients or the need to travel abroad in order to access treatment.\\nin addition, there has been little improvement in the number of countries meeting minimum \\nradiotherapy resource requirements over the last two years. only 20.9\\xa0percent of countries \\nworldwide met the minimum requirement in 2022 (see dashboard). this stagnation in \\ntechnological penetration is likely due to a variety of factors, including financial constraint, lack \\nof trained personnel, infrastructural challenges and lack of awareness of the clinical role played \\nby radiotherapy in the management of cancer.\\n\\nglobal innovation index 2023 41 socioeconomic impact\\nthe socioeconomic impact of innovation remains low. labor productivity has come to \\na standstill, life expectancy continues to fall (including a slowdown in life expectancy \\nimprovement), and carbon dioxide emissions have returned to pre-pandemic levels. this is \\nlikely to be a rebound from the profound impact that covid-19 has had on all three of these \\nindicators. while life expectancy is sure to start increasing again in the future, developments in \\nlabor productivity and carbon dioxide emissions are less certain.\\nlabor productivity\\neconomists and policymakers around the world have been worrying about low productivity \\ngrowth and how to revive the broken link between innovation and productivity – the theme \\nof last year’s gii 2022, what is the future of innovation-driven growth?  – for a number of \\nyears. the year 2020 saw a sharp increase in global labor productivity (almost 4\\xa0percent). \\nyet this productivity spike was short-lived. one reason for the strong productivity growth \\nrates seen early on in the pandemic (i.e., 2020) is that it was the less productive, in-person \\nservice activities that were most effected by lockdowns. this artificially raised the aggregate \\neconomy productivity level rather than it being a result of underlying technological progress. \\nconsequently, hopes for a productivity revival were dashed again when employment readjusted \\nand output per hour worked declined once again in 2021 to about 1\\xa0percent growth, and then \\ndown to zero in 2022 – the lowest growth rate seen in decades.\\nit is also notable how related economic data have fluctuated wildly in the past. in addition \\nto volatile output and employment data (mostly due to lockdowns), changes in inflation, as \\nwell as geopolitical tensions, have also influenced productivity measures. forecasts for 2023 \\nforesee a modest uptick in productivity to about 1\\xa0percent, dampened in particular by negative \\nproductivity readings in europe and the united states.27 prospects for 2024 and beyond look \\nbetter, but are highly uncertain. whether the digital age and deep science innovation waves \\noutlined in the gii 2022 will reverse this productivity crisis continues to be a matter of debate. \\nonly the next one to two decades will tell.28\\nlife expectancy\\nnowadays, life expectancy is around 20 years longer than it was in 1960 (51 years). however, \\ncovid-19 contributed to the first observed drop in life expectancy in 2020, and it continued \\nto fall in 2021. this meant that life expectancy was nearly two years lower in 2021 (71 years) \\ncompared to pre-pandemic levels (73 years in 2019).\\nexamining well-being in aging and the role of innovation also involves reviewing the \\ndevelopment of healthy life expectancy – an important measure of what people aspire to.29 \\non average, healthy life stops about nine years before death. figure 8 illustrates the relatively \\nconstant difference between the two concepts.\\nfigure 8 \\u2003life expectancy and healthy life

significant reduction in global carbon \\ndioxide (co2) emissions in 2020. unfortunately, 2021 witnessed a notable rebound, with \\nemissions increasing by 5.3\\xa0percent, more than reversing the pandemic-induced decline.\\nin 2022, the growth of co2 emissions slowed again to 1.7 percent growth over 2021 – which \\nis still higher than the 10-year trend of 0.7 percent (see dashboard). comparing the first five \\nmonths of 2023 to those of 2022, the increase in co2 emissions appears very modest, with \\na 0.3\\xa0percent growth, but data are provisional and growth is still positive with no global \\nreductions of co2 emissions in sight.30\\nconclusion\\nthe gii’s global innovation tracker provides a data-driven perspective on the latest innovation \\ntrends and impacts. the main findings of the 2023 edition are as follows:\\n –after a boom in 2021, investments in science and innovation showed a more mixed \\nperformance in 2022.\\xa0 scientific publications, r&d and venture capital deals continued to \\nincrease and are at historically high levels. novel innovation waves offer unseen possibilities, \\nand leading innovation nations and innovation-intensive firms are ramping up their \\ninnovation efforts. but growth was lower than the exceptional rates seen in 2021. in fact, \\nthe value of vc investment has declined, possibly foreshadowing how tighter monetary \\nconditions might come to affect innovation finance, and making the outlook for 2023 and \\n2024 uncertain.\\n –a topical question is whether the pandemic and subsequent economic downturn will have \\nlasting negative impacts on less mature innovation systems in middle- and low-income \\neconomies, as well as on emerging firms and start-ups. the 2021 and 2022 data necessary to \\nanswer this critical question is not as yet available in most cases.\\n\\nglobal innovation index 2023 43  –judging from data available to the gii, technology adoption is growing. yet penetration \\noften remains low. as outlined in preceding gii reports, fostering adoption in some sectors, \\nsuch as agri-food, green or medical innovations, poses a significant challenge. novel, \\ndemand-led innovation approaches, plus new regulatory set-ups and other fresh efforts \\nare required.\\n –measures of the socioeconomic impact of innovation suggest weak, if not declining, progress \\nin recent years.\\xa0to a large extent, this reflects the impact of the covid-19 pandemic.\\xa0 how \\nstrongly they will rebound, as once the impact of the pandemic recedes, remains an open \\nquestion. \\xa0\\nnotes\\n1 imf, 2023.\\n2 massimo and verginer, 2022.\\n3 among middle-income economies, next to china, türkiye and serbia registered unprecedented growth in r&d in \\n2021, with gerd increasing by 15.6\\xa0percent and 18.1\\xa0percent, respectively. other middle-income economies that \\nincreased their total r&d in 2021 include kazakhstan (+7.8\\xa0percent), armenia (+4\\xa0percent), egypt (+2.9\\xa0percent) and \\nuzbekistan (+2\\xa0percent).\\n4 government r&d budget indicators for the oecd area present the amounts that governments agree to allocate to \\nr&d as part of their budgetary processes, rather than actual expenditure reported by r&d performers. notably, \\neconomies like japan witnessed an impressive surge of 59\\xa0percent in 2020 in real terms, while australia experienced a \\nnoteworthy increase of 18\\xa0percent. the republic of korea and the united kingdom also demonstrated strong growth \\nrates of 15\\xa0percent and 8\\xa0percent between 2019 and 2020, respectively, and the united states 12\\xa0percent.\\n5 oecd, 2023 notes that “data for 2021 indicate that the decline r&d budgets was principally explained by the \\nreadjustment to health r&d. this year marks the return to growth in undirected r&d funding (general university \\nfunds and other funding for the general advancement of knowledge).”\\n6 china

when looking at nominal growth rates, as they have not yet been adjusted for inflation. growth \\nin r&d intensities can in that sense be more informative, as inflation is cancelled out.\\n9 airbnb is

depending on how the financial year is defined.\\ngovernment r&d budget, 2020–2022\\ngovernment r&d budget allocations grew robustly in 2020 for the majority of mostly high-\\nincome countries, who are also the biggest r&d spenders.4 this positive outcome can be \\nattributed to government efforts to support r&d expenditures as a counter-cyclical measure; a \\nstrategy that effectively sustained 2020 r&d growth.\\nin 2021, however, government r&d budgets diverged, with declines seen in japan \\n(−10.9\\xa0percent) and the united states ( −8.8\\xa0percent), the two biggest r&d spenders covered. \\ndeclines were also observed in other major economies in 2021. this can be explained by \\na downward re-adjustment to governments’ health r&d budgets in selected high-income \\neconomies.5 meanwhile, other major economies continued to ramp up their r&d budgets, \\nnamely, the republic of korea (+10.2\\xa0percent), türkiye (+9.6\\xa0percent), germany (+5.6\\xa0percent \\nin 2021) and france (+2.5\\xa0percent). data for china are unavailable; however, official chinese \\nstatistics show an increase in government funding of 6\\xa0percent in 2020 and 10\\xa0percent in 2021.6\\nfor those economies that have already disclosed their planned 2022 r&d budgets, the outlook \\nis mixed. significant increases in real 2022 r&d budget appropriations are planned for japan \\n(+15.2\\xa0percent) and the republic of korea (+6.5\\xa0percent), with a smaller increase planned \\nfor germany (+1.0 percent). the united states ( −1.8\\xa0percent), on the other hand, foresees a

wind electricity generation costs fell by around \\n13\\xa0percent between 2020 and 2021 (see dashboard). this means that 70\\xa0percent (96\\xa0percent) \\nof the solar (wind) generation capacity newly installed in 2021 is cheaper and thus more \\ncompetitive than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired new generation option (see figure 6). this \\nmakes it possible to target cost-saving incentives at encouraging the adoption of low-emission \\ntechnologies, instead of relying on regulation or taxation to deter high-emission activities. \\nhowever, despite this notably positive progress, the decrease in cost recorded in 2021 may not \\ncontinue into the future, owing to rises in associated material costs that are yet to be passed \\nonto customers.17 even though, at present, the exceptionally high price of fossil fuels far \\noutweighs increases in material commodity prices, the future is uncertain, not least because of \\ngeopolitical volatility and its unpredictable effect on fossil fuel prices.\\n\\nglobal innovation index 2023 37 figure 6 \\u2003share of newly-installed renewable power generation capacity that is cheaper \\nthan the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option,

option, at usd\\xa054/mwh for a \\nccgt in the united states.\\nelectric battery price\\ntechnological progress has persistently driven down the cost of lithium-ion batteries for \\nover a decade, making evs increasingly affordable. however, following more than a decade \\nof decreasing prices, the rising cost of raw materials and battery components, coupled with \\nsoaring inflation, resulted in a first ever increase in the cost of a lithium-ion battery pack, up \\n7.1\\xa0percent in 2022 compared to the year before (i.e., from usd 141 to usd 151/kwh). indeed, \\nprices could have risen even further, if not for the greater use of alternative low-cost battery \\nmaterials like lithium-ion phosphate in the production process and a continued reduction in the \\nuse of expensive cobalt.\\nbattery prices are projected to remain at a similar level next year, contrary to significant \\ndeclines in the past. however, starting in 2024, as lithium prices ease and additional extraction \\nand refining capacity becomes available, battery prices are projected to resume a downward \\ntrajectory. the day that battery packs fall to a price of usd 100/kwh (relative to usd 151/kwh \\ntoday) is thought to be the day that evs will be no different in purchase price to petrol and diesel \\npowered vehicles. ambitious policy programs that emphasize the strengthening of domestic \\nsupply chains and encourage reshoring of electric battery and ev production have contributed \\nto increased local supply.\\ncost of genome sequencing\\npart of the ongoing deep science innovation wave (see gii 2022 special theme ), future medical \\ninnovation is particularly dependent on advances in genetics and stem cell research. in turn, \\ndna sequencing plays a crucial role in understanding the human genome, which has numerous \\npotential applications in health care, including in the rapid diagnosis of complex diseases and \\nthe fight against new viruses such as covid-19.\\nthe cost and time involved in sequencing a human or other organism’s genome are important \\nfactors in the success of dna sequencing technology. the cost of sequencing an entire genome \\nhas decreased dramatically over the years, based on estimates valid for the united states. \\nas shown in figure 7, it has fallen from approximately usd\\xa0100\\xa0million in 2001 to just over \\nusd\\xa0500 in 2022. this rapid decrease in cost, driven by advancements in next-generation dna \\nsequencing methods, far outpaces the progress expected from moore\\'s law, highlighting the \\nremarkable technological progress that has been made in the field.\\n\\nglobal innovation index 202338 figure 7 \\u2003cost of sequencing dna of one human genome, 2001–2022

below usd\\xa0500, with the advent of new sequencing \\ntechnologies, and made accessible to the general public, especially in health care settings.\\nnew, forward-looking metrics will also be required in order to assess the speed and cost of \\nmore advanced dna sequencing techniques in the future. emerging long-read dna sequencing \\ntechnologies provide for more accurate identification of complex structural variations, but they \\nare more expensive and require different metrics to track progress.19\\nfinally, the pricing and accessibility of dna sequencing outside of the united states, and \\nparticularly in low- and middle-income nations, will be a key metric of success that needs to be \\ndeveloped further.\\ndrug approvals\\ndrug approvals provide an insight into the cutting-edge pharmaceutical treatments being \\nintroduced to the market. in the united states – which boasts the world’s biggest drugs market – \\nthere were 37 approvals in 2022, marking a 26\\xa0percent decline from 2021. looking at the 10-year \\ntrend shows a slight average annual decline of 0.5\\xa0percent over the period.\\nwhat can we gather from these numbers? on the one hand, the 37 approvals in 2022 indicates a \\nsignificant decrease in the number of new drugs entering the market compared to the previous \\nfive years. this challenges the optimism surrounding scientific advancements such as mrna \\nand crispr technology, which were expected to stimulate a wave of new pharmaceutical \\ntreatments. on the other hand, historical data show that annual drug approval numbers are \\nprone to fluctuation. the 10-year downward trend overall is largely the result of a short-term \\nincrease in 2012 and a short-term decrease in 2022. the coming years will reveal whether \\nthe decline observed in 2022 was an anomaly or indicative of a more fundamental drop in \\ndrug approvals.\\n\\nglobal innovation index 2023 39 technology adoption\\nthe global state of technology adoption reveals both progress and challenges in addressing \\npressing global issues. access to safe sanitation has improved, but over 40\\xa0percent of the \\nworld’s population continues to lack safe sanitation. industrial robot installation has surged, \\ndriven by supply chain disruption and automation efforts, leading to increased efficiency and \\nreshoring. electric vehicle sales are booming, with positive ripple effects on battery production. \\nmeanwhile, the availability of radiotherapy for cancer treatment remains inadequate in many \\ncountries, likely owing to financial constraints, lack of trained personnel and infrastructural \\nchallenges. overall, technology penetration rates are still medium-to-low, with the exception of \\nmobile broadband.\\nsafe sanitation\\nin an effort to track the adoption of health-related innovations, the global innovation tracker \\nnow includes data on the availability of safe sanitation. safe sanitation refers to that proportion \\nof the population that uses an improved sanitation facility that is not shared and is safe. this \\nindicator shows important progress over the last two decades, with a notable improvement of \\n1.4\\xa0percent between 2021 and 2022 (compared to 2.4\\xa0percent over 2012–2022). progress has \\nbeen quickest in central and southern asia (+6.6\\xa0percent over 2012–2022) driven by a strong \\ngrowth in availability of safe sanitation in india and east and south east asia (+4.6\\xa0percent) \\nattributable to progress in china.\\nin 2022, 57\\xa0percent of the world’s population (4.5\\xa0billion people) had access to safe sanitation. \\na decade earlier, it was still only 45\\xa0percent, and in 2000 it stood at 32\\xa0percent. since 2012, \\n1.3\\xa0billion people have gained access to safe sanitation across all regions, and 2.5\\xa0billion since \\n2000.20 that said, there is still a long way to go. a little under half of the global population of \\n3.5\\xa0billion people still lacks safe sanitation. to reach the sustainable development goal target \\nof universal coverage by 2030, the annual rate of progress would need to increase to 7.4\\xa0percent \\nfrom 2022 onward, up from 2.4 percent over the last decade. disaggregated data also reveal \\nsignificant disparities in access to safe sanitation both between and within countries. the \\nsituation remains dire in rural areas, where coverage is lower (46\\xa0percent) than in urban areas \\n(65\\xa0percent), and in some of the world’s regions, such as sub-saharan africa, only just under a \\nquarter of people (24\\xa0percent) have safe sanitation.\\nconnectivity\\nin 2022, fixed broadband subscriptions grew by 4.8\\xa0percent, while mobile broadband \\nsubscriptions grew by 6\\xa0percent, both below the 10-year average. mobile broadband adoption \\nis more widespread, with 87 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants.21 in contrast, fixed broadband \\nsubscriptions stood at only 17.6 per 100 inhabitants, though these are typically shared within \\nhouseholds and therefore cover more people. penetration rates for fixed broadband – which is \\noften necessary for more advanced applications – remained poor in low-income economies.\\nconnectivity to 5th generation mobile networks\\xa0(5g) could help make up for lagging fixed \\nbroadband subscriptions rates. this new standard allows for faster, more reliable data \\ntransmission, and better suits the operation of connected machines, objects and devices \\n(the internet of things), and thereby serves as an enabler unlocking the full potential of the \\ndigital era.\\nin 2021, according to estimates, 19\\xa0percent of the world\\'s population was covered by 5g. \\neurope had the highest rollout at 52\\xa0percent, followed by latin america and north america \\nwith 38\\xa0percent and the asia-pacific region at 16\\xa0percent. high infrastructure costs, device \\naffordability, and regulatory and adoption barriers remain the primary obstacles to 5g \\ndeployment and could foster a digital divide.22\\nrobots and automatization\\nthe number of industrial robots currently in operation grew by 14.6\\xa0percent between 2020 \\nand 2021 (see dashboard) to 3.4\\xa0million robots. major supply chain disruption due to the \\ncovid-19 pandemic and other disruptions to global trade have driven increased automation \\n\\nglobal innovation index 202340 and reshoring efforts – together boosting new robot installations to a record high of 0.5\\xa0million \\nin 2021, representing a growth rate of 31.4 percent on 2020. robots have also become less \\ncomplicated to operate, owing to their programming being increasingly intuitive to non-experts, \\nthanks to advancements in user-friendly interfaces and sensor technologies.23\\nthe top five markets for industrial robots are china, which leads with 52\\xa0percent of new \\ninstallations, followed by japan (9\\xa0percent), the united states (7\\xa0percent), the republic of korea \\n(6\\xa0percent) and germany (5\\xa0percent). combined, these five countries represented 78\\xa0percent of \\nnew robot installations globally, in 2022.24\\nelectric vehicles\\ndemand for evs is booming. in just two years, the market share of ev sales worldwide surged \\nfrom 4\\xa0percent in 2020 to 14\\xa0percent in 2022. sales of evs surpassed 10\\xa0million units, marking a \\nremarkable 55\\xa0percent increase between 2021 and 2022, while traditional car sales slumped by \\n3\\xa0percent.25 this was despite the first ever observed increase in electric battery pack prices in \\n2022 (see technological progress section above). moreover, cars are just the first wave: electric \\nbuses and trucks will follow soon, while electric three-wheelers are already booming in major \\nmarkets such as india, where over half of its three-wheeler registrations in 2022 were electric.\\nencouraging ev trends are generating positive ripple effects for battery production and supply \\nchains. ambitious policy programs that put an emphasis on strengthening domestic supply \\nchains and encourage reshoring – such as the european union’s\\xa0(eu) net zero industry act and \\nthe united states’ inflation reduction act – have sparked significant planned investment by \\nmajor ev and battery makers. to maximize the environmental benefits from ev transition, it is \\ncrucial to simultaneously address not only the sources of the electricity used to charge evs, but \\nraw material extraction and battery disposal.26\\nnevertheless, at present, out of every car on the world’s roads (in 2022) only 2.1\\xa0percent are \\nelectric (see dashboard). this represents an ev stock of 26\\xa0million, half of which is in china \\n(13.8\\xa0million). europe maintained its position as the second largest market for electric cars \\nworldwide, in 2022, accounting for 30\\xa0percent of global stock. evs remain the fastest growing \\nindicator (+59.9\\xa0percent and more than five times the stock in 2018, see dashboard) in the global \\ninnovation tracker this year, and further growth can be expected, regardless of uncertainty \\nconcerning how attractive traditional petrol or diesel vehicles will continue to be in the future.\\ncancer radiotherapy\\nto better capture the adoption of health-related innovations, the 2023 global innovation tracker \\nincludes data on the availability of cancer therapy equipment. a significant measure in the field \\nof radiation oncology and medical physics is the total number of linear accelerators\\xa0(linacs) – \\ndevices for delivering high-energy x-rays or electrons to cancers for a therapeutic or palliative \\npurpose – per cancer case requiring radiotherapy.\\nthis metric can be regarded as a measure of the accessibility of cancer treatment infrastructure \\nat the global level. international atomic energy agency\\xa0(iaea) and directory of radiotherapy \\ncentres (dirac) data show cancer therapy has become less widely available, declining by \\n−1.4\\xa0percent in the short term (2020–2022) and by −1.3\\xa0percent over the last decade (2012–2022). \\nthis suggests there has been an increase in cases of cancer requiring radiotherapy without an \\nadequate corresponding increase in the number of linacs, potentially leading to longer waiting \\ntimes for patients or the need to travel abroad in order to access treatment.\\nin addition, there has been little improvement in the number of countries meeting minimum \\nradiotherapy resource requirements over the last two years. only 20.9\\xa0percent of countries \\nworldwide met the minimum requirement in 2022 (see dashboard). this stagnation in \\ntechnological penetration is likely due to a variety of factors, including financial constraint, lack \\nof trained personnel, infrastructural challenges and lack of awareness of the clinical role played \\nby radiotherapy in the management of cancer.\\n\\nglobal innovation index 2023 41 socioeconomic impact\\nthe socioeconomic impact of innovation remains low. labor productivity has come to \\na standstill, life expectancy continues to fall (including a slowdown in life expectancy \\nimprovement), and carbon dioxide emissions have returned to pre-pandemic levels. this is \\nlikely to be a rebound from the profound impact that covid-19 has had on all three of these \\nindicators. while life expectancy is sure to start increasing again in the future, developments in \\nlabor productivity and carbon dioxide emissions are less certain.\\nlabor productivity\\neconomists and policymakers around the world have been worrying about low productivity \\ngrowth and how to revive the broken link between innovation and productivity – the theme \\nof last year’s gii 2022, what is the future of innovation-driven growth?  – for a number of \\nyears. the year 2020 saw a sharp increase in global labor productivity (almost 4\\xa0percent). \\nyet this productivity spike was short-lived. one reason for the strong productivity growth \\nrates seen early on in the pandemic (i.e., 2020) is that it was the less productive, in-person \\nservice activities that were most effected by lockdowns. this artificially raised the aggregate \\neconomy productivity level rather than it being a result of underlying technological progress. \\nconsequently, hopes for a productivity revival were dashed again when employment readjusted \\nand output per hour worked declined once again in 2021 to about 1\\xa0percent growth, and then \\ndown to zero in 2022 – the lowest growth rate seen in decades.\\nit is also notable how related economic data have fluctuated wildly in the past. in addition \\nto volatile output and employment data (mostly due to lockdowns), changes in inflation, as \\nwell as geopolitical tensions, have also influenced productivity measures. forecasts for 2023 \\nforesee a modest uptick in productivity to about 1\\xa0percent, dampened in particular by negative \\nproductivity readings in europe and the united states.27 prospects for 2024 and beyond look \\nbetter, but are highly uncertain. whether the digital age and deep science innovation waves \\noutlined in the gii 2022 will reverse this productivity crisis continues to be a matter of debate. \\nonly the next one to two decades will tell.28\\nlife expectancy\\nnowadays, life expectancy is around 20 years longer than it was in 1960 (51 years). however, \\ncovid-19 contributed to the first observed drop in life expectancy in 2020, and it continued \\nto fall in 2021. this meant that life expectancy was nearly two years lower in 2021 (71 years) \\ncompared to pre-pandemic levels (73 years in 2019).\\nexamining well-being in aging and the role of innovation also involves reviewing the \\ndevelopment of healthy life expectancy – an important measure of what people aspire to.29 \\non average, healthy life stops about nine years before death. figure 8 illustrates the relatively \\nconstant difference between the two concepts.\\nfigure 8 \\u2003life expectancy and healthy life

years of healthy living beyond 60 years of age, while some \\n55 countries have a life expectancy of under 60 years.\\ncarbon dioxide emissions\\nstrict lockdowns and travel restrictions resulted in a significant reduction in global carbon \\ndioxide (co2) emissions in 2020. unfortunately, 2021 witnessed a notable rebound, with \\nemissions increasing by 5.3\\xa0percent, more than reversing the pandemic-induced decline.\\nin 2022, the growth of co2 emissions slowed again to 1.7 percent growth over 2021 – which \\nis still higher than the 10-year trend of 0.7 percent (see dashboard). comparing the first five \\nmonths of 2023 to those of 2022, the increase in co2 emissions appears very modest, with \\na 0.3\\xa0percent growth, but data are provisional and growth is still positive with no global \\nreductions of co2 emissions in sight.30\\nconclusion\\nthe gii’s global innovation tracker provides a data-driven perspective on the latest innovation \\ntrends and impacts. the main findings of the 2023 edition are as follows:\\n –after a boom in 2021, investments in science and innovation showed a more mixed \\nperformance in 2022.\\xa0 scientific publications, r&d and venture capital deals continued to \\nincrease and are at historically high levels. novel innovation waves offer unseen possibilities, \\nand leading innovation nations and innovation-intensive firms are ramping up their \\ninnovation efforts. but growth was lower than the exceptional rates seen in 2021. in fact, \\nthe value of vc investment has declined, possibly foreshadowing how tighter monetary \\nconditions might come to affect innovation finance, and making the outlook for 2023 and \\n2024 uncertain.\\n –a topical question is whether the pandemic and subsequent economic downturn will have \\nlasting negative impacts on less mature innovation systems in middle- and low-income \\neconomies, as well as on emerging firms and start-ups. the 2021 and 2022 data necessary to \\nanswer this critical question is not as yet available in most cases.\\n\\nglobal innovation index 2023 43  –judging from data available to the gii, technology adoption is growing. yet penetration \\noften remains low. as outlined in preceding gii reports, fostering adoption in some sectors, \\nsuch as agri-food, green or medical innovations, poses a significant challenge. novel, \\ndemand-led innovation approaches, plus new regulatory set-ups and other fresh efforts \\nare required.\\n –measures of the socioeconomic impact of innovation suggest weak, if not declining, progress \\nin recent years.\\xa0to a large extent, this reflects the impact of the covid-19 pandemic.\\xa0 how \\nstrongly they will rebound, as once the impact of the pandemic recedes, remains an open \\nquestion.

(+4\\xa0percent), egypt (+2.9\\xa0percent) and \\nuzbekistan (+2\\xa0percent).\\n4 government r&d budget indicators for the oecd area present the amounts that governments agree to allocate to \\nr&d as part of their budgetary processes, rather than actual expenditure reported by r&d performers. notably, \\neconomies like japan witnessed an impressive surge of 59\\xa0percent in 2020 in real terms,

      "To enhance Canada's position relative to that of the United Kingdom and the United States in terms of innovation, the four critical factors to focus on from the provided list would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Research & Development (R&D) Expenditure**: Increasing R&D expenditure is foundational for driving innovation. Both the UK and US have strong R&D investments, so for Canada to compete or outpace, it would need to significantly boost its own R&D spending. This includes encouraging both governmental and private sector investment in R&D to foster innovation across various industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Public-Private Collaboration**: Strengthening collaboration between academic institutions, government, and the private sector can accelerate the innovation process significantly. Canada has the potential to enhance its innovation ecosystems by fostering better linkages and synergy between these entities, learning from models that have proved successful in the UK and the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Market Sophistication and Access to Capital**: Accessibility of finance can make or break innovation ecosystems. Improving access to venture capital, crowdfunding, and other financial instruments for startups and innovative enterprises is crucial. Canada should aim to create a more favorable environment for investment in new technologies and startups, potentially looking at successful policies and frameworks in the UK and US as benchmarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Global Collaboration and Openness**: Enhancing international partnerships and participating more actively in global research projects can significantly augment Canada's innovation capabilities. Openness to global talent and collaboration not only helps in the cross-pollination of ideas but can also position Canada as a global leader in specific innovation sectors. This approach can leverage Canada's existing strengths and foster unique advantages over both the UK and the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "Focusing on these four factors could help Canada strengthen its innovation ecosystem, making it more competitive on the global stage, particularly in relation to the United Kingdom and the United States.\n"
